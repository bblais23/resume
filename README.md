# Resume

This repository serves as a place for me to store my resume. It requires no building as it is a straight HTML site. 

## Browsersync

While not needed as this is a purely static site, I have included browsersync in the dev dependencies. It is useful for its live update features.

I have attached the serve script to default configuration for this.
```bash
npm run serve
```
